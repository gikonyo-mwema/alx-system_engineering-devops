## Root cause and resolution 
The root cause of the issues was corruption of the linux virtual machine files by a virus in my windows host computer. This led to the vm using up all the memory and cpu leading to a freeze. The linux would keep trying to load for a long time without results. 
The solution was to run antivirus software and update windows. Then the vm causing the issues was discarded. A new version V22 was installed and set up.
## Corrective and preventative 
A backup copy of the public and private keys used to connect to the web servers has been created. Also configuration files have been backed up for faster future recovery.
